					<h4>What do I get when I purchase a Data Studio template?</h4>
					<p>
						When you purchase a <span class="underlined_pink">Data Studio template</span> you are getting a custom built dashboard that visualizes and displays your data.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Google Data Studio </strong>seamlessly connects with other products from the Google Marketing Platform. This means that once you have purchased a report, you can connect your Google Analytics (or any other data source) to the template and begin analyzing your own data to better understand your business. Purchasing a template gives you access to a hidden template that you are able to copy.  Once you have copied it, the copied version is yours to edit and change as you like.

					<h4>What happens once I purchase a Data Studio template?</h4>

					</p>
					<p>

					<h4>What is a Data Studio template?</h4>
					<p>
						A Data Studio template is a reporting template that can be used with Google’s data visualization tool Data Studio.
					</p>
					<p>
						Data Studio templates come in many different shapes and sizes, and can visualize your data in attractive, stylish reports. Data Studio connects to a multitude of data sources, such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="underlined_pink">Google Analytics</li>
						<li class="underlined_pink">Google Ads</li>
						<li class="underlined_pink">Google Search Console</li>
						<li class="underlined_pink">Google Sheets,</li>
						<li>SQL databases and...</li>
						<li>many more!</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Whereas previously you had to look at data in each of these products separately, with Data Studio you can combine multiple data sources into one comprehensive report.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Frequently Asked Question -->
				<div>
					<h4>Is Google Data Studio free?</h4>
					<p>
						Yes, Data Studio is free. It is part of the Google Marketing Platform, which also includes the popular website measurement tool Google Analytics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of the reports that we offer connect to data sources that require a 3rd party connector like Supermetrics.  In these case you may need to purchase a subscription from the connector in order for the template to connect to these data sources.  In these cases we have clearly stated this in the template description.
					</p>
					<p>
						While this is the case, Data Studio itself is still free and if you want to access certain data sources, whether you use data studio or any other dashboarding or BI tool, you will still require a 3rd party connector.
